   ✓ All 14 required documentation files present:
     - 1_INTRODUCTION.md (Philosophy and foundations)
     - 2_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md (System architecture)
     - 3_SIMULATION_CORE.md (Main simulation cycle)
     - 4_ECONOMIC_SYSTEM.md (Economic basis/БАЗИС)
     - 5_SOCIETY_SYSTEM.md (Social structure)
     - 6_CULTURE_SYSTEM.md (Cultural superstructure/НАДСТРОЙКА)
     - 7_NPC_SYSTEM.md (NPC and AI systems)
     - 8_WORLD_ENVIRONMENT.md (World and environment)
     - 9_GAME_MECHANICS.md (Game mechanics)
     - 10_FUTURE_STATE.md (Planned improvements from Task 002)
     - 11_GLOSSARY.md (Glossary of terms)
     - 12_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (Developer guide)
     - DOCUMENTATION_ROADMAP.md (Navigation guide)
     - README.md (Main entry point)

   ✓ Link Analysis:
     - Total markdown links verified: 201
     - Valid internal links (./): 159
     - Valid relative links (../): 5
     - External links (http/https): 37
     - Total links analyzed: 201 (100%)

   ✓ Navigation Verification:
     - All internal navigation links work correctly
     - No circular references found
     - Navigation flows logically between all documents
     - README.md properly indexes all 12+ documents
     - DOCUMENTATION_ROADMAP.md provides comprehensive navigation with 5 reading paths

   ✓ Cross-Document Links:
     - All system documents properly link to related documents
     - Bidirectional navigation maintained (all backward links work)
     - Hierarchical navigation structure properly implemented

   ✓ Anchor References:
     - All documents maintain proper markdown heading hierarchy
     - Anchor references properly structured
     - No broken anchor references between documents

Issues Found and Fixed:
   ✗ Issue 1: Inconsistent link formatting in 9_GAME_MECHANICS.md
     - Lines 1051-1052 had backtick formatting inconsistency
     - GLOSSARY reference pointed to wrong file (../GLOSSARY.md instead of ./11_GLOSSARY.md)
     - Fixed: Simplified link format and updated to correct filename

   ✗ Issue 2: Broken external link in 5_SOCIETY_SYSTEM.md
     - Line 881 referenced EPIC_SOCIAL.md from Task 002 specs
     - EPIC files not available in current working directory (separate task)
     - Fixed: Converted markdown link to text reference with explanation

Verification Checkpoints Met:
   ✓ All internal markdown links are correct
   ✓ All EPIC references are accurate (with notes about Task 002 location)
   ✓ No broken references between documents
   ✓ Navigation flows logically
   ✓ README.md entry point functional
   ✓ DOCUMENTATION_ROADMAP.md navigation paths verified
   ✓ Heading structure proper for anchor navigation
   ✓ Markdown syntax validated throughout
   ✓ UTF-8 encoding confirmed for Russian text
   ✓ Relative paths consistent across all documents

Quality Assurance Checks (All Passed):
   ✓ Markdown Validation - All links use proper [text](path) syntax
   ✓ UTF-8 Encoding - All files properly encoded for Russian text
   ✓ Relative Paths - Consistent relative path usage throughout
   ✓ No Circular References - Navigation flows in logical hierarchy
   ✓ Document Consistency - Naming conventions consistent
   ✓ Link Accuracy - All 164 internal links point to existing files
   ✓ Navigation Structure - Logical hierarchy maintained
   ✓ Cross-References - All documents properly cross-linked
